(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Most of the lesson was new code, so we basically spent the lesson looking at the board and learning new blocks then whizzing off to our desks and copying it. My 'individuality' was helpful, because my maze is different - it has moving blocks, and a mini-maze in it, and also my baddie doesnâ€™t bounce off obstacles. He just goes around the board. That way my game is harder and more challenging. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Again the time constraint but otherwise nothing really bothered me or prevented my learning or development of the maze game.</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I might go a bit with the herd of sheep and make my baddie bounce off the maze; but I can't really because of the smaller maze. I might add another baddie but I think that would make the game a bit too hard. Next time also, I could add a title screen, and a death screen, possibly another level.</td>

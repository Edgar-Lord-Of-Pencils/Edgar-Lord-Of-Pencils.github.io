    <td>At the beginning of the lesson, I filled out a Childline survey, then we got onto github, and off Classroom copied some free code to use for our github pages. But before that, we had a chat with Mr. Keen about McDonald's. I learned that you should use your own initiative to solve problems, and in McDonalds, all the employees follow a strict set of rules and, essentially, do not use their brain. We then were told we had a choice whether to be McDonalds guys, or something else like highly paid programmers. The very secret, smart, efficient, quick, and successful masterplan was to listen. I also learnt how to authorise and publish documents on drive.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The main problem was because the turning chairs were so fun, it was hard to do work without spinning around my work area. Also, when the McDonald's warning was issued, I had only been to McDonald’s once, so I was slightly unaware of the premises and capabilities of the place. During the lesson, I was having trouble authorising Gabriel because the computer was not loading the page, so I had to wait until I got home [now]. The other limit was that I have not a fantastic memory, so all the changing, editing, shmediting was so far up ahead I had to write most of the information down in my homework diary.</td>

    <td>I must fearlessly hole myself back from the necessity to do 360’s on my spinning chair 24/7, and to do some kind of practice at home on my memory. I will improve my learning by if not understanding something, possibly create a drive document with all the notes instead of writing it down in my diary. I must also have more hope, as I was freaking out at the fact that gabriel was not being authorised, and that I wouldn't be able to catch up, and that it was the end of the world…[well me, anyway]. I should've not panicked and instead of asking Mr.Keen 'HELP!!!’ I should’ve said to myself: ‘oh well, I’ll try it at home. If it goes wrong there, then I’ll go to Mr.Keen’. I should also simplify things; I interpreted ‘now copy this code and tweak it’ to ‘open 3 hideously oversized documents and use your knowledge from your 20 PhD’s and then make this outrageously complicated code into an elegant webpage’. I stress out too much over simple things that I do not yet understand.</td>

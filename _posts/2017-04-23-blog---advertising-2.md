    <td>To start, we needed to play 'media bingo', and find as many people whose answers to certain questions were ‘yes’. We received a document which we could not change and had to open it in dochub to edit it. After a couple minutes of searching for buttons in vain, I had to ask someone to help me. Now I know how dochub works and how to open files using it. Also during the lesson, Mr.Keen asked us to stand on a corresponding side of the room [yes or no] based on our opinion of a question. I learnt not by being a sheep in a crowd, but by having my own opinion.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Obviously it is a problem that I didn’t know how to find something as easy to find as dochub. However, as soon as I got home, I had forgotten how the person instructed me to get to dochub, yet I found the answer in seconds. I think that during the lesson I was worried how everybody else has found dochub but I hadn’t, so I wasn’t thinking clearly. I need to work on focusing on my own work and perhaps not getting distracted. Also, during the second activity, I was shocked finding out what people thought, forgetting that everyone had their own opinion.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>On the first activity I should have focused more and got the answer quicker. I could do this by thinking more clearly and focusing on my work. I could think: "Right there's this button here. When I click it some things slide out… blablabla… aha! 'Open in dochub’!". Also, next time I should [on the second activity] think about the questions more as on some of my replies I had to move to another side of the room because I realised what the question meant. Before doing so, I was also glancing around to see what other people thought. Next time I should not focus on others [as with the first activity] and focus on MYself or MY work.</td>

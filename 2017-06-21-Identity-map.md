  <tr>
    <td>I learnt a lot not only about how I had done my piece of work compared to the class but also what other people were like. Some people's identity maps were rather plain, and not much text. From that I learnt that they were simple, whereas if it was colourful I could see they were positive, if it was cramped then they were eager to share etc. I think the activity was very good and taught me a lot about other people.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It isn’t much, but when we were going around the table commenting on other people’s work we had to wait for the next person to finish commenting before we could do that one. And since a few people did this very slowly, sometimes we had to wait around 2 minutes to move onto the next identity map. This didn’t really limit my learning as I still got to look at all of them but if the lesson was shorter, it would have.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time for the homework: I think I should have done it on a flat A3 paper not my multiple A5's because some people didn’t see that it was a slider and it had words behind, so they didn’t see my whole effort, but If I had done it on A3 flat then it would be visible straight away. Next time for the lesson/commenting: I think I could have varied my comments a little bit because for a few of them I was just saying the same things, and the people who I was feedbacking didn’t really learn much.</td>
